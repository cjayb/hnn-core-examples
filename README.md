# Demonstrations using hnn-core

The purpose of this repository is to provide demonstrations on the use of
[https://github.com/jonescompneurolab/hnn-core](hnn-core). The scope is
different compared with the examples provided with `hnn-core` on its
[https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/auto_examples/index.html](website).
Here, we can investigate the potential of `hnn-core` by implementing various
simulations, some of which are prohibitively long-running to be included in the
"official" example suite. We can also test ideas on new visualisations or ways
to develop the API.

We welcome Issues and Pull Requests!
